Debugs are in ALL Modules

# Ansible Ad-HOC commands

An Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes:

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_adhoc.html

On network devices we can use the raw module to run ad-hoc commands.

ansible usa -m raw -c paramiko -a "show ip interface brief"

# Playbooks

Cisco IOS Modules
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/

Module:  cisco.ios.{{name of module}}:

         cisco.ios.ios_banner:

Before you can use a module you want to make sure you have the collection by
running this command:

ansible-galaxy collection list
 
If the module is not listed in the collection you can install with:

ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ios

# Variables

Ansible is running python under the hood.  

Concept of a variable or var is a value that can change through out the exectution of a program.

Example:  a username
name:  {{ name }}  <--Variable memory location holding data

Ansible can define host or group variables

# Host and group variable files

Must use YAML syntax

host variables are unique to the host like an ip address

group variables apply to a group of hosts in the inventory

How to build Ansible Inventory includes organizing host and group variables

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#organizing-host-and-group-variables

Ansible loads host and group variable files by searching paths relative to the inventory file or the playbook file.

Order of operations - 
  - Host var will be selected over a group var
  - Child group 
  - Parent group
  - All group last

By default Ansible merges groups at the same parent/child level in "ASCII" order, and the last group loaded overwrites the previous groups. For example, an a_group will be merged with b_group and b_group vars that match will overwrite the ones in a_group.

# Accessing Data using Variables

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#referencing-nested-variables

Many registered variables (and facts) are nested YAML or JSON data structures. You cannot access values from these nested data structures with the simple {{ foo }} syntax. You must use either bracket notation or dot notation.

For example, to reference an IP address from your facts using the bracket notation:

{{ ansible_facts["eth0"]["ipv4"]["address"] }}

To reference an IP address from your facts using the dot notation:

{{ ansible_facts.eth0.ipv4.address }}

# Defining Playbook Variables

Define variables directly in ansible playbook.

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#defining-variables-in-a-play

You can define variables directly in a playbook play:

- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80

When you define variables in a play, they are only visible to tasks executed in that play.

Defining variables in included files and roles
You can define variables in reusable variables files and/or in reusable roles. When you define variables in reusable variable files, the sensitive variables are separated from playbooks. This separation enables you to store your playbooks in a source control software and even share the playbooks, without the risk of exposing passwords or other sensitive and personal data. For information about creating reusable files and roles, see Re-using Ansible artifacts.

This example shows how you can include variables defined in an external file:

---

- hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  vars:
    favcolor: blue
  vars_files:
    - /vars/external_vars.yml

  tasks:

  - name: This is just a placeholder
    ansible.builtin.command: /bin/echo foo

# Understanding Loops

https://github.com/IPvZero/CodeSamples/tree/main/Ansible/Vars_Loops

Used Perform repetitive tasks.

Examples:  

Configuration needed on multiple interfaces
ip ospf 1 area 0 

Configuring multiple NTP servers
ntp-server [ variable ip ]

Two types of loops

For loop 
While loop

Ansible Loop module documentation

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_loops.html

Ansible offers the loop, with_<lookup>, and until keywords to execute a task multiple times.

Example:  Loop over a list using item special key word

---

- name: "NTP CONFIG PLAYBOOK"
  hosts: cisco
  gather_facts: false
  connection: network_cli

  tasks:
    - name: "Loop through NTP servers and configure"
      vars:
        myservers:
          - "1.1.1.1"
          - "2.2.2.2"
          - "3.3.3.3"
          - "4.4.4.4"
      cisco.ios.ios_ntp_global:
        config:
          peers:
              - peer: "{{ item }}"
                version: 2
      loop: "{{ myservers }}"

Looping through configured interfaces

---

- name: "Loop test"
  hosts: usa
  gather_facts: true
  connection: network_cli

  tasks:
    - name: "Loop through IP info"
      debug:
        msg: "{{ ansible_net_hostname }} has an IP address {{ item }} configured"
      loop: "{{ ansible_net_all_ipv4_addresses }}"

# Conditional Logic & Filtering

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html

What is Conditional Logic?

"If" a condition is met "then" something can happen.

"If" a condition is not met "Else" can happen.

The When Keywork:

Basic conditionals with when keyword

The when clause is a raw Jinja2 expression without double curly braces (see group_by_module).

Logical Operators:

"And" logic both conditions have to be true

"Or" logic in at least one of the statements must be true

Example using multiple conditions using Logical Operators with Parantheses:

tasks:
  - name: Shut down CentOS 6 and Debian 7 systems
    ansible.builtin.command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
    when: (ansible_facts['distribution'] == "CentOS" and ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "6") or
          (ansible_facts['distribution'] == "Debian" and ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "7")


Using a list a Logical "And" Operator is implied:  All conditions must be met to true.

tasks:
  - name: Shut down CentOS 6 systems
    ansible.builtin.command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
    when:
      - ansible_facts['distribution'] == "CentOS"
      - ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "6"

Writing a Conditional Playbook:

Transforming dictionaries into lists | dict2items }}"

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#transforming-dictionaries-into-lists

---

- name:  "Playbook to test conditional logic"
  hosts: usa
  gather_facts: true
  connection: network_cli

  tasks:
    - name: "Task 1 print out facts"
      debug:
        msg: "Interface {{ item['key'] }} has an ip address of {{ item['value']['ipv4']['address'] }}" 
      loop: "{{ ansible_net_interfaces | dict2items }}"
      when: item['value']['type'] == "routed"
